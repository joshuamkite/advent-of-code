The first part of this challenge was simple. The second part was more tricky because words substrings overlap and it is neccessary to remove matched substrings to get the 'correct' numbers subsequently. Initially I was able to match the test input and visual sampling but was getting a result declared to be too low to be correct. On a whim I decided to cut back from identifying 'all' numbers in each line in favour of finding only the first number starting on the left and only the last number starting on the right. This turned out to give the 'correct' solution.
