I will concede that I solved this one mostly with ChatGPT as the problem was somewhat beyond me initially. Amusingly ChatGPT (1o mini) seemed unable to get to a correct answer for part 2, continually offering variations that gave the same solution. What made the difference was what I have often found works well for LLM acceleration:

- Stepping back from the larger problem to a smaller subset- here the sample `test.txt` input as per worked example
- Declaring an approach. Here the prompt that 'fixed' the umpteenth faulty iterations was:

> this is still the same. I feel that we need a different approach for part 2: we both start at valve AA, then presumably we both move to separate valves and so on. Assuming that each actor optimises for their own local maximum relief in the time available and ignores valves that are already opened, save to pass by them, what would the code look like?

The longer version from ChatGPT on how that was implemented: 

### **Part One**: Single Actor

- **Objective**: Maximize total pressure release within **30 minutes**.
- **Constraints**:
  - Start at valve `AA`.
  - Each tunnel traversal takes **1 minute**.
  - Opening a valve takes **1 minute** and can only be done once.
  
### **Part Two**: Two Actors

- **Objective**: Maximize the combined total pressure release within **26 minutes** each.
- **Constraints**:
  - Both actors start at valve `AA`.
  - Both actors can move independently but cannot open the same valve.
  - Valve openings by one actor are inaccessible to the other.
  
## Solution Approach

### Initial Approach and Missteps

The initial solution effectively solved **Part One** by implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy with memoization to explore all possible sequences of valve openings within the **30-minute** limit. However, **Part Two** presented challenges:

- **Incorrect Pressure Calculation**: The initial implementation inadvertently allowed both actors to open the same valve, leading to overcounted pressures.
- **Performance Issues**: As the number of useful valves increased, the combinatorial explosion made the solution inefficient, especially for **Part Two**.

The core issue stemmed from **improper tracking of opened valves**, allowing overlapping assignments between the two actors and resulting in incorrect total pressure calculations.

### Optimized Approach with Bitmasking

To address the missteps and enhance both **correctness** and **efficiency**, the solution was revamped using **bitmasking**. This technique offers several advantages:

1. **Efficient Subset Representation**: Each useful valve is assigned a unique bit position within an integer. This allows for compact and efficient representation of any subset of valves.
2. **Accurate Overlap Detection**: Bitmasking enables swift determination of overlapping subsets using bitwise operations, ensuring that both actors work on disjoint sets of valves.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Bitwise operations are computationally inexpensive, significantly speeding up the process of checking and managing valve states, especially crucial for larger datasets.
